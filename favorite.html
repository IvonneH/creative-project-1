        <h2>Mother to Son</h2>
        <h3>By Langston Hughes</h3>
        <p>
            Well, son, I’ll tell you:<br>
            Life for me ain’t been no crystal stair.<br>
            It’s had tacks in it,<br>
            And splinters,<br>
            And boards torn up,<br>
            And places with no carpet on the floor—<br>
            Bare.<br>
            But all the time<br>
            I’se been a-climbin’ on,<br>
            And reachin’ landin’s,<br>
            And turnin’ corners,<br>
            And sometimes goin’ in the dark<br>
            Where there ain’t been no light.<br>
            So boy, don’t you turn back.<br>
            Don’t you set down on the steps<br>
            ’Cause you finds it’s kinder hard.<br>
            Don’t you fall now—<br>
            For I’se still goin’, honey,<br>
            I’se still climbin’,<br>
            And life for me ain’t been no crystal stair.<br>
        </p>
               
        <h2>The Children's Hour</h2>
        <h3>By Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h3>
        <p>
            Between the dark and the daylight, <br>
            When the night is beginning to lower, <br>
            Comes a pause in the day's occupations, <br>
            That is known as the Children's Hour. <br>
            <br>
            I hear in the chamber above me <br>
            The patter of little feet, <br>
            The sound of a door that is opened, <br>
            And voices soft and sweet. <br>
            <br>
            From my study I see in the lamplight, <br>
            Descending the broad hall stair, <br>
            Grave Alice, and laughing Allegra, <br>
            And Edith with golden hair. <br>
            <br>
            A whisper, and then a silence: <br>
            Yet I know by their merry eyes <br>
            They are plotting and planning together <br>
            To take me by surprise. <br>
          
            A sudden rush from the stairway, <br>
            A sudden raid from the hall! <br>
            By three doors left unguarded <br>
            They enter my castle wall! <br>
            <br>
            They climb up into my turret <br>
            O'er the arms and back of my chair; <br>
            If I try to escape, they surround me; <br>
            They seem to be everywhere. <br>
            <br>
            They almost devour me with kisses, <br>
            Their arms about me entwine, <br>
            Till I think of the Bishop of Bingen <br>
            In his Mouse-Tower on the Rhine! <br>
            <br>
            Do you think, O blue-eyed banditti, <br>
            Because you have scaled the wall, <br>
            Such an old mustache as I am <br>
            Is not a match for you all! <br>
            <br>
            I have you fast in my fortress, <br>
            And will not let you depart, <br>
            But put you down into the dungeon <br>
            In the round-tower of my heart. <br>
            <br>
            And there will I keep you forever, <br>
            Yes, forever and a day, <br>
            Till the walls shall crumble to ruin,<br>
            And moulder in dust away!<br>
        </p>

        <h2>Dinosaur Poem</h2>
        <h3>Bill Watterson</h3>
        <p>
            Eighty million years ago,<br>
            Back in the late cretaceous,<br>
            Lived the great Tyrannosaur,<br>
            A fearsome and predacious<br>
            Therapod of monstrous size!<br>
            He weighed siz tons or more!<br>
            He epitomized the concept of <br>
            The killer carnivore!<br>
            <br>
            His jaws had teeth like railroad spikes<br>
            With fore and aft serrations!<br>
            This dental hardware was designed<br>
            For quick eviscerations!<br>
            With thrashing bites and awful roars<br>
            The T. Rex would attack!<br>
            He was, it's clear, a savage Mesozoic maniac!<br>
            <br>
            Imagine then, the panic caused,<br>
            The horror and the mayhem,<br>
            When this monster came to town<br>
            And ate some folks this A.M.!<br>
            It was a sight few will forget!<br>
            He lunged into the crowd<br>
            The multitude became unglued!<br>
            Their screams were long and loud!<br>
            <br>
            People pushed to get away!<br>
            The elderly and small<br>
            Were trampled underfoot by the<br>
            Advancing human wall!<br>
            Little Tim was on an errand<br>
            With his brother howard.<br>
            They dawdled by the candy shop<br>
            And both boys were devoured.<br>
            <br>
            A camera crew from channel three<br>
            Arrived in town to give<br>
            A live report. At this they failed,<br>
            Because they didn't live.<br>
            At last the menace ate his full.<br>
            The big Tyrannosaur<br>
            Stomped away to parts unknown<br>
            where he had lived before.<br>
            <br>
            Tyrannosaurs, though rarely seen,<br>
            Are certainly still around.<br>
            And no one knows just where or when<br>
            The next one will be found.<br>
            <br>
            ....Except me.
        </p>
