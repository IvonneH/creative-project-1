        <h2>Basketball</h2>
        <p>
            Pay attention.<br>
            Keep focus.<br>
            Eye on the ball.<br>
            I am the ball. It is me.<br>
            It thinks my thoughts, It is my head.<br>
            Don’t let me lose it.
        </p>

        <h2>Tangled Hair</h2>
        <p>
            My hair isn't dry,<br>
            But I'll be fine.<br>
            Maybe. It won't brush well<br>
            When wet, it gets tangled.<br>
            Forcing a brush through it is painful.<br>
            Why don't I have time to dry my hair?<br>
            <br>
            I still get fed up with my hair<br>
            When it is dry.<br>
            If I forget to brush it, it could still be painful,<br>
            But I didn't forget so I'm fine.<br>
            Still, it continues to be tangled,<br>
            Though I brush it well.<br>
            <br>
            Oh, well.<br>
            It’s not the fault of my hair<br>
            That it gets tangled.<br>
            Even when it’s dry.<br>
            It’s fine.<br>
            Not painful.<br>
            <br>
            Painful?<br>
            Well,<br>
            Fine<br>
            Hair!<br>
            Dry<br>
            Tangled!<br>
            <br>
            When I was little, my mom would leave it tangled.<br>
            But my dad would brush it, and comb it, which was painful.<br>
            Tangled hair every day? This old joke is dry.<br>
            I guess I've learned my lesson well.<br>
            I can't argue with my hair.<br>
            It always wins, and that's fine.<br>
            <br>
            What really bugs me is when I can't fine-<br>
            D a hairbrush! Because hairdryer cords are all tangled,<br>
            To get ready for school I need to brush my hair.<br>
            To be late for such a reason would be painful.<br>
            If I’m late my grade wouldn't fair well.<br>
            Just because my hair won't dry!<br>
            <br>
            A pathetic kind of painful.<br>
            I want my hair to look well,<br>
            So hair, please dry!
        </p>
