        <h2>Family Reunion</h2>
        <p>
            Tahoe is the taste of trees towering above me<br>
            The smell of napping, sun-cooked needles twice as long as my hand.<br>
            <br>
            My hand hits ice cold water,<br>
            As we try to catch shadow-shy fish.<br>
            But their tiny bendy bodies slip silently between my fingers.<br>
            <br>
            My fingers grasp the top bunk,<br>
            And I pull myself up.<br>
            My cousins are asleep,<br>
            So I welcome the warming covers<br>
            Keeping out cold coming creeping from an open window,<br>
            I feel the night’s breath whisper in my ear and glide by my cheek.<br>
            <br>
            My cheek is all red, and my forehead and nose,<br>
            From a day spent climbing rocks under a blinding sun,<br>
            A happy hatlessness and a shameless shoelessness<br>
            Developing sunburns and calluses,<br>
            Having fun. I’ve won.<br>
            I’m a happy Hilton, perfectly at home here.<br>
            I’m a cousin, a niece, a granddaughter, a sister.<br>
            Gathered on the gravel beach, I see my cousins. I smile.<br>
            <br>
            My smile sticks like wet sand<br>
            For the remainder of the reunion.<br>
            Then I realize it’s time to return home.<br>
            At a run, I race to my cousin-best-friend.<br>
            It could be a year till I see her again.<br>
            My feet bounding, my heart pounding<br>
            My arms wrap around, we cling<br>
            To each other, saying goodbye. I sigh.<br>
            A feeling of family is rooted to this spot,<br>
            It beats in my heart.<br>
            It tickles my face and numbs my hand.<br>
            Blowing in the breeze and burning my skin,<br>
            It swims past my fingers and into my soul.
        </p>
            
        <h2>Ponderosa</h2>
        <p>   
            I wrap my arms around yam-colored peanut-brittle bark<br>
            Because my brother told me to smell it. It’s flaky and warm.<br>
            With a deep breath, I find it’s sweet. like vanilla. or butterscotch.<br>
            Pulling away, dismayed, I find shiny, sticky sap on my fingers,<br>
            And I see little ants crawling on the orange bark. Egh.<br>
            Maybe I shouldn't have touched the tree.<br>
            Just smelled it.<br>
            <br>
            My other brother says the needles taste the way they smell.<br>
            He knows from experience.<br>
            I ponder the Ponderosa.<br>
            Wouldn't it be wonderful if the bark tasted the way it smelled?<br>
            With melt in your mouth goodness,<br>
            It would be as sweet as maple syrup.<br>
            <br>
            Oh, what a tasty treat is this beautiful day!<br>
            Mighty pines are scattered about towers of orange rock<br>
            Which are bumpy and lopsided.<br>
            Like popsicles melting in the summer sun.<br>
            I see people far below in the canyon, as little as ants.<br>
            The breeze brings me scents of pine sap,<br>
            And in the deep blue expanse above me hang wispy tufts of cotton candy.
        </p>

        <h2>Rest</h2>
        <p>
            Eyes closed. Lying on the soft spring lawn.<br>
            In the shade.
        </p>
            
        <h2>My Mountains</h2>
        <p>
            I push off the trampoline as hard as I can.<br>
            Determined to launch my sister higher than ever before.<br>
            We are both grinning,<br>
            I am pushed by an unexpectedly strong gust of wind.<br>
            I look where it came from, my grand gray mountains.<br>
            A wave of clouds splash over those northern mountains,<br>
            Preparing to flood the valley in slow motion.<br>
            The wind ushers in this storm,<br>
            Which will soon fill the valley to it’s brim, and run over.<br>
            <br>
            My mom drives me to school,<br>
            And I turn to look out the back window.<br>
            There I see my morning mountain,<br>
            That launches the sun, but only when I'm at the house.<br>
            Maybe it does it for me.<br>
            Through the front windshield,<br> 
            I can barely see a mountain through the haze.<br>
            To the right, Timpanogos.<br>
            To the left, a shining lake with distant mountains behind.<br>
            I’m surrounded.<br>
            It makes me feel protected.<br>
            <br>
            I run outside at the word fire.<br>
            My mountain on fire.<br>
            An ever growing gray cloud gains ground,<br>
            And fills the sky.<br>
            Airborne firefighters fly by, dumping retardant.<br>
            But I see a burst of flame on the smoke’s edge.<br>
            Seemingly smaller than a birthday candle.<br>
            A pine tree exploding.<br>
            Those trees become black as my scuffed dress shoes as their<br> 
            Needles and bark are shred into an upward surge of smoke.<br>
            But my mountain is steady.
        </p>
                
        <h2>Adrift</h2>
        <p>
            Rippled sunlight rests on rocks<br>
            Beneath the lake’s glassy surface,<br>
            On which lies reflected colors fled<br>
            From pine trees and stones.<br>
            Snow covered mountains and a wide blue sky,<br>
            I give it a glance<br>
            Before stretching Safari out of its corner<br>
            Placing its page<br>
            In front of the forest<br>
            Displayed on my desktop.<br>
            With so much to see,<br>
            You Tube, Facebook, Studio C,<br>
            I become lost on the lake.<br>
            A few clicks bring me Netflix.<br>
            I get settled on the bed<br>
            And my sister picks the show.<br>
            I dive, go below, completely submerged.<br>
            I come up for air after three episodes.<br>
            But I have homework.<br>
            My sister leaves.<br>
            Alone on the lake, I sail up to Google docs.<br>
            With feet firm on the shore,<br>
            I research and write.<br>
            It’s midnight.<br>
            Good night.<br>
            I exit the window,<br>
            To see the forest once more,<br>
            And log off.  
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
